## Tool Description

## CLI Usage
Description

## Furture Directions
- Separating I/O file reading functionality from graph analysis and graph data visualization
- Convert all I/O files (Excel, CSV, GML, etc) to GML for standardization of graph representation and edgelist/nodelist for exports to more human readable formats.
- Provide convenient means to filter graphs, show graph outputs, and save useful file outputs.
